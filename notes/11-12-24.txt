Use Big O notation to express the time complexity.
Big O notation gives an upper bound on the number of operations performed.

Common time complexities include:
O(1) - constant time complexity
O(log n) - logarithmic time complexity
O(n) - linear time complexity
O(n log n) - linearithmic time complexity
O(n^2) - quadratic time complexity
O(2^n) - exponential time complexity
